    DeviceDescription: A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a
      computer. The motherboard is a computer's central communications backbone connectivity
      point, through which all components and external peripherals connect. Motherboards
      can be found in virtually all computers, especially desktop and laptop PCs.

    DeviceDescription: "A power supply is a component that supplies power to at least
      one electric load. Typically, it converts one type of electrical power to another,
      but it may also convert a a different form of energy \u2013 such as solar,
      mechanical, or chemical - into electrical energy. A power supply provides components
      with electric power."

    DeviceDescription: The processor, also known as the CPU, provides the instructions
      and processing power the computer needs to do its work. The more powerful and
      updated your processor, the faster your computer can complete its tasks. By
      getting a more powerful processor, you can help your computer think and work
      faster.

    DeviceDescription: RAM stands for random-access memory, but what does that mean?
      Your computer RAM is essentially short term memory where data is stored as
      the processor needs it. This isn't to be confused with long-term data that's
      stored on your hard drive, which stays there even when your computer is turned
      off.
